## 🎯 What We're Building

**Project Example: Insurance EOB Tracker**

Imagine you have medical insurance and receive "Explanation of Benefits" (EOB) documents after doctor visits. These documents show:
- How much you've spent toward your deductible
- What categories expenses fall into (office visit, lab work, prescriptions, etc.)
- How much insurance paid vs. what you owe

We're going to build a web application that:
- Lets you upload or enter EOB data
- Tracks your total spending against your deductible
- Organizes expenses by category
- Shows you at a glance how much more you need to spend before insurance kicks in
- Displays charts and summaries of your healthcare spending

By the end of this guide, you'll have a working foundation for this project and know how to continue building it with AI assistance.

## 🛠️ Understanding the Tools

Before we start, let's understand what each tool does and why we need it.

### What is a Terminal?

**Think of it as:** A text-based way to talk to your computer

- **Mac**: Called "Terminal" - it's already installed
- **Windows**: Called "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell"
- **What it does**: Lets you type commands to make your computer do things (create folders, run programs, install software)
- **Why we need it**: Most programming tools are controlled through text commands

**Analogy**: If your computer's graphical interface (clicking icons) is like ordering food at a restaurant by pointing at pictures, the terminal is like ordering by speaking directly to the chef.

### What is Git?

**Think of it as:** A "save game" system for your code

- **What it does**: Keeps track of every change you make to your project
- **Why we need it**:
  - You can go back to any previous version if you break something
  - You can see what changed and when
  - You can collaborate with others without overwriting their work
  - It's like "Track Changes" in Microsoft Word, but much more powerful

**Analogy**: Like having an infinite undo button that remembers every version of your project forever.

### What is Visual Studio Code (VSCode)?

**Think of it as:** Microsoft Word, but for code

- **What it does**: A text editor specifically designed for writing code
- **Why we need it**:
  - Colors your code to make it easier to read
  - Suggests completions as you type (like autocomplete on your phone)
  - Helps you find and fix errors
  - Integrates with all the other tools we'll use

**Analogy**: You could write code in Notepad, just like you could write a novel there. But VSCode gives you spell-check, grammar suggestions, formatting tools, and more.

### What is Python?

**Think of it as:** The language we'll write in

- **What it does**: A programming language that's easy for humans to read and write
- **Why we need it**: Django (our web framework) is built with Python
- **Why Python**: It reads almost like English, making it perfect for beginners

**Analogy**: If building a website is like building a house, Python is the language you speak to tell the construction workers what to do.

### What is pyenv?

**Think of it as:** A manager for different versions of Python

- **What it does**: Lets you have multiple versions of Python on your computer
- **Why we need it**: Different projects might need different Python versions; this keeps them separate
- **Bonus**: Creates "virtual environments" - isolated workspaces for each project

**Analogy**: Like having different toolboxes for different jobs. Your plumbing toolbox doesn't mix with your electrical toolbox.

### What is Django?

**Think of it as:** A website construction kit

- **What it does**: Provides pre-built components for common website features (user login, database, admin panel, etc.)
- **Why we need it**: Instead of building everything from scratch, we get a professional foundation
- **What's included**:
  - Database system (stores your data)
  - User authentication (login/logout)
  - Admin interface (manage your data)
  - Security features (keeps hackers out)
  - URL routing (connects web addresses to pages)

**Analogy**: Building a website from scratch is like building a car from raw metal. Django is like getting a car chassis, engine, and wheels already assembled - you just customize it.

### What is PostgreSQL?

**Think of it as:** A super-organized filing cabinet

- **What it does**: Stores all your application's data in organized tables
- **Why we need it**: Our insurance tracker needs to remember all your EOB entries, categories, spending amounts, etc.
- **Why not just use files**: Databases are much faster and can handle millions of records efficiently

**Analogy**: You could keep all your files in one big pile on your desk, or you could use a filing cabinet with labeled drawers and folders. PostgreSQL is the filing cabinet.

### What is Docker?

**Think of it as:** A shipping container for your application

- **What it does**: Packages your entire application with everything it needs to run
- **Why we need it**: Ensures your app runs the same way on any computer
- **What it includes**: Your code, Python, PostgreSQL, web server, everything

**Analogy**: Like those meal prep kits - everything you need comes in one box, perfectly portioned and ready to use.

## 💻 Installing Everything You Need

Let's install each tool step by step. These instructions are for **Mac** (since you're on macOS). Windows users will have slightly different steps.

### Step 1: Open Terminal

1. Press `Command + Space` (opens Spotlight search)
2. Type "Terminal"
3. Press Enter

You'll see a window with white or black background and a blinking cursor. This is your terminal.

**What you'll see**: Something like:
```
YourName@MacBook-Pro ~ %
```

This is called a "prompt" - it's waiting for you to type a command.

### Step 2: Install Homebrew (Package Manager)

**What is Homebrew?** Think of it as an "App Store for developers" - it installs programming tools easily.

1. In Terminal, paste this command (copy everything on one line):
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Press Enter
3. Enter your Mac password when prompted (you won't see characters as you type - this is normal)
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for installation

**How to verify it worked**:
```bash
brew --version
```

You should see something like: `Homebrew 4.x.x`

### Step 3: Install Git

**In Terminal, type:**
```bash
brew install git
```

Wait for it to finish, then verify:
```bash
git --version
```

You should see: `git version 2.x.x`

**Configure Git with your name and email:**
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Replace "Your Name" and the email with your actual information.

### Step 4: Install VSCode

**Two ways to install:**

**Option A: Download from website**
1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Click the download button for Mac
3. Open the downloaded file
4. Drag "Visual Studio Code" to your Applications folder

**Option B: Install with Homebrew**
```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

**Verify**: Open VSCode by pressing `Command + Space`, typing "Visual Studio Code", and pressing Enter.

### Step 5: Install pyenv

**In Terminal:**
```bash
brew install pyenv
```

**Configure your shell to use pyenv:**

1. Check what shell you're using:
```bash
echo $SHELL
```

If it says `/bin/zsh`, you're using zsh (most modern Macs).

2. Add pyenv to your shell configuration:
```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

3. Restart your terminal (close and reopen it) or run:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Verify:**
```bash
pyenv --version
```

### Step 6: Install Python with pyenv

**Install Python 3.13.3** (or latest version):
```bash
pyenv install 3.13.3
```

This takes 5-10 minutes.

**Set it as your global Python version:**
```bash
pyenv global 3.13.3
```

**Verify:**
```bash
python --version
```

Should show: `Python 3.13.3`

**That's it for installation!** ✅

You now have everything you need to build Django applications. We're using SQLite for the database (built into Python), so no database installation needed.

## 📚 Your First Steps with Terminal

Before we dive into the project, let's learn basic terminal commands. Think of these as learning to walk before you run.

### Understanding Your File System

**Key concept**: Everything on your computer is organized in folders (also called "directories"). The terminal lets you navigate these folders using text commands.

**The filesystem tree:**
```
/                           (root - the top of everything)
└── Users
    └── YourName           (your home directory)
        ├── Desktop
        ├── Documents
        ├── Downloads
        └── Coding         (we'll create this)
```

### Essential Commands

Open Terminal and try these:

#### 1. `pwd` - Print Working Directory
**Shows where you are right now**

```bash
pwd
```

Output: `/Users/YourName` (your current location)

#### 2. `ls` - List
**Shows files and folders in current location**

```bash
ls
```

Output: `Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Pictures`

**See more details:**
```bash
ls -la
```

This shows hidden files, permissions, and sizes.

#### 3. `cd` - Change Directory
**Move to a different folder**

```bash
cd Desktop          # Go to Desktop
cd ..               # Go up one level (to parent folder)
cd ~                # Go to home directory
cd /Users/YourName/Documents  # Go to specific path
```

**Practice:**
```bash
cd Desktop
pwd                 # Should show /Users/YourName/Desktop
cd ..
pwd                 # Should show /Users/YourName
```

#### 4. `mkdir` - Make Directory
**Create a new folder**

```bash
mkdir Coding
```

This creates a "Coding" folder in your current location.

#### 5. `cp` - Copy
**Copy files or folders**

```bash
cp file.txt backup.txt           # Copy a file
cp -r folder backup_folder       # Copy a folder (-r means recursive)
```

#### 6. `mv` - Move or Rename
**Move or rename files/folders**

```bash
mv oldname.txt newname.txt       # Rename
mv file.txt Documents/           # Move to Documents folder
```

#### 7. `rm` - Remove
**Delete files or folders**

```bash
rm file.txt                      # Delete a file
rm -r folder                     # Delete a folder (-r means recursive)
```

**⚠️ WARNING**: `rm` is permanent - there's no Trash/Recycle Bin!

### Practice Exercise

Let's create a practice project structure:

```bash
# Go to your home directory
cd ~

# Create a Coding folder
mkdir Coding

# Go into it
cd Coding

# Create a practice folder
mkdir practice

# Go into it
cd practice

# Create some files (the 'echo' command creates a file with text)
echo "Hello World" > test.txt

# See what's in the file
cat test.txt

# Create a folder structure
mkdir -p project/src/components

# See the structure
ls -R
```

**What each command did:**
- `mkdir -p` creates nested folders (creates all parents if needed)
- `echo "text" > file.txt` creates a file with that text
- `cat file.txt` shows the contents of a file
- `ls -R` lists everything recursively (shows subfolders too)

### Terminal Tips

**Shortcuts to save time:**
- `Tab` - Auto-complete (start typing a filename and press Tab)
- `↑` (Up Arrow) - Shows previous command
- `Ctrl + C` - Stop a running command
- `Ctrl + A` - Go to beginning of line
- `Ctrl + E` - Go to end of line
- `Ctrl + U` - Clear entire line
- `clear` - Clear the terminal screen

**Practice auto-complete:**
```bash
cd ~/Cod<TAB>       # Press Tab after typing 'Cod', it will complete to 'Coding'
```

---

## 🚀 Setting Up Your Django Project

Now we'll set up the actual project that will become your insurance tracker.

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Coding Folder

```bash
cd ~/Coding
pwd                 # Verify you're in /Users/YourName/Coding
```

### Step 2: Clone the Template from GitHub

Instead of copying a local folder, we'll download (clone) the template from GitHub:

```bash
# Clone the template repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BuildTemplate.git InsuranceTracker

# Go into your new project
cd InsuranceTracker
```

**What just happened:**
- `git clone` downloaded the entire template from GitHub
- We named our local copy "InsuranceTracker"
- The folder contains all the starter files we need

**What is cloning?** Think of it like downloading a zip file, but better:
- You get the entire project with all its history
- You can pull updates if the template improves
- Git tracks everything automatically

**Alternative (if you have the template locally):**
If you already have BuildTemplate on your computer, you can copy it:
```bash
cp -r /path/to/BuildTemplate ~/Coding/InsuranceTracker
cd ~/Coding/InsuranceTracker
```

### Step 3: Open Project in VSCode

```bash
code .
```

**What this does**: Opens the current folder (`.` means "current folder") in VSCode.

**First time only**: If VSCode doesn't open, you may need to install the `code` command:
1. Open VSCode manually
2. Press `Command + Shift + P`
3. Type "shell command"
4. Click "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"
5. Try `code .` again

### Step 4: Explore the Project in VSCode

In VSCode, you'll see a sidebar with folders. This is your project structure. Let me explain what each folder does:

```
InsuranceTracker/
├── apps/                  # Where your Django apps live (we'll create 'insurance' here)
├── build/                 # Build scripts for deployment
├── config/               # Django project settings (will be created)
├── docker/               # Docker configuration files
│   ├── nginx/           # Web server config
│   └── postgres/        # Database config
├── docs/                # Documentation
├── static/              # CSS, JavaScript, images
│   ├── css/            # Your custom styles
│   ├── js/             # JavaScript files
│   └── images/         # Images for your site
├── templates/          # HTML templates for your pages
├── .env.example        # Example environment variables
├── docker-compose.yml  # Defines all services (Django, PostgreSQL, Nginx)
├── Makefile           # Shortcuts for common commands
├── requirements.txt   # Python packages needed (will be created)
└── manage.py          # Django's command-line tool (will be created)
```

### Step 5: Create a Python Virtual Environment

**What is a virtual environment?**
Think of it as a separate workspace for this project's tools. Just like you might have separate toolboxes for different hobbies (one for woodworking, one for electronics), a virtual environment keeps this project's Python packages separate from other projects.

**Why do we need this?**
- Project A might need Django version 4.0
- Project B might need Django version 5.0
- Without virtual environments, you'd have constant conflicts
- With virtual environments, each project has its own isolated set of packages

**Let's create one:**

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project folder
cd ~/Coding/InsuranceTracker

# Create a virtual environment named 'insurance-tracker' using Python 3.13.3
pyenv virtualenv 3.13.3 insurance-tracker

# Activate it for this folder
pyenv local insurance-tracker
```

**What each command does:**

1. **`pyenv virtualenv 3.13.3 insurance-tracker`**
   - Creates a new virtual environment
   - Uses Python version 3.13.3
   - Names it "insurance-tracker"
   - This is like creating a new toolbox

2. **`pyenv local insurance-tracker`**
   - Creates a `.python-version` file in your folder
   - This file tells pyenv "whenever I'm in this folder, use the insurance-tracker environment"
   - It's automatic from now on - every time you `cd` into this folder, the right environment activates

**Verify it's active:**
```bash
python --version    # Should show Python 3.13.3
which python        # Should show a path with 'insurance-tracker' in it
```

**What you should see:**
```
Python 3.13.3
/Users/YourName/.pyenv/versions/insurance-tracker/bin/python
```

The path shows "insurance-tracker" - that means you're using the right environment!

**Troubleshooting:**
- If `python --version` shows a different version, try closing and reopening your terminal
- Make sure you're in the InsuranceTracker folder (`pwd` to check)
- If it still doesn't work, run `pyenv local insurance-tracker` again

### Step 6: Install Django and Essential Packages

First, let's create a `requirements.txt` file that lists what packages we need:

**In VSCode:**
1. Click "New File" icon in the left sidebar (or press `Command + N`)
2. Paste this content:

```txt
Django==5.0.1
python-dotenv==1.0.0
pillow==10.2.0
```

3. Save as `requirements.txt` in the root folder (File → Save, or `Command + S`)

**What each package does:**

- **`Django==5.0.1`** - The web framework itself
  - This is the main package that provides everything (models, views, templates, admin, etc.)
  - The `==5.0.1` means "install exactly version 5.0.1" (ensures consistency)

- **`python-dotenv==1.0.0`** - Loads environment variables from `.env` file
  - Lets you store secrets (passwords, API keys) in a file that's not committed to Git
  - Example: instead of hardcoding your email password in code, you store it in `.env`

- **`pillow==10.2.0`** - Handles image uploads
  - Useful for uploading photos of receipts or EOB documents
  - Django needs this for ImageField and processing images

**Notice what we DON'T need:**
- No PostgreSQL driver (we're using SQLite, which is built into Python)
- No Redis or Celery (not needed for a simple tracker)
- Just 3 packages! Keeping it simple.

**Install these packages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**What this does:**
- `pip` is Python's package installer (like an app store)
- `-r requirements.txt` means "read the list from this file"
- It downloads and installs each package and their dependencies

This takes 1-2 minutes. You'll see lots of output - that's normal!

**Verify Django is installed:**
```bash
django-admin --version
```

Should show: `5.0.1`

If you see `5.0.1`, you're good to go! ✅

### Step 7: Create the Django Project

```bash
# Create the project configuration
django-admin startproject config .
```

**Important**: Note the `.` at the end! This means "create the project in the current folder" rather than creating a new subfolder.

**What this created:**
```
config/
├── __init__.py          # Makes this a Python package
├── settings.py          # Main Django settings
├── urls.py              # URL routing configuration
├── asgi.py              # Async server config
└── wsgi.py              # Web server config
manage.py                # Django management command tool
```

**Verify it worked:**
```bash
python manage.py --version
```

Should show: `5.0.1`

### Step 8: Create Your First Django App (Insurance Tracker)

Django projects are organized into "apps". Each app handles a specific feature. We'll create an app for our insurance tracking.

```bash
# Create the app
python manage.py startapp insurance

# Move it into the apps/ folder (better organization)
mv insurance apps/
```

**What this created:**
```
apps/insurance/
├── __init__.py
├── admin.py           # Register models for admin interface
├── apps.py            # App configuration
├── models.py          # Database models (we'll define EOB data here)
├── tests.py           # Write tests here
├── views.py           # Handle web requests
└── migrations/        # Database change history
```

### Step 9: Configure Django Settings

We need to tell Django about our new app and configure file storage for uploads.

**Open** `config/settings.py` in VSCode.

This file contains all of Django's configuration. Let's make a few changes:

#### A. Register Your Insurance App

**Find the `INSTALLED_APPS` list** (around line 33) and add your app:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'apps.insurance',           # Add this line
]
```

**What this does:**
- Tells Django "this app exists and should be included"
- Django will now look for models, templates, and views in this app
- The admin interface will be able to find your models

**Why `apps.insurance`?**
- Because we moved the `insurance` folder into `apps/`
- The dot notation means "inside the apps folder, find insurance"
- If we hadn't moved it, we'd just write `'insurance'`

#### B. Check the Database Configuration

**Scroll down to the `DATABASES` section** (around line 75).

You should see something like this:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
```

**Don't change this!** This is Django's default, and it's perfect for learning.

**What this means:**
- **`ENGINE`** - Which database system to use (SQLite in this case)
- **`NAME`** - Where to store the database file
  - `BASE_DIR` is your project root folder
  - `/` joins paths (works on Mac, Windows, Linux)
  - This creates a file called `db.sqlite3` in your project root

**Why SQLite is great for beginners:**
- No installation needed (built into Python)
- Just a single file - easy to understand
- Easy to delete and start over (just delete the file)
- Fast enough for thousands of records
- When you're ready, switching to PostgreSQL is just changing these 4 lines

#### C. Configure Static and Media Files

**Find `STATIC_URL`** (around line 117) and add these lines after it:

```python
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / 'static',
]
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles'

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
```

**What these settings do:**

- **`STATIC_URL = '/static/'`**
  - The URL prefix for static files (CSS, JavaScript, images that are part of your site design)
  - Example: A CSS file at `static/css/style.css` will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/static/css/style.css`

- **`STATICFILES_DIRS`**
  - List of folders where Django should look for static files during development
  - We're telling it to look in the `static/` folder in our project root

- **`STATIC_ROOT`**
  - Where to collect ALL static files when deploying to production
  - The `python manage.py collectstatic` command copies everything here
  - Not used during development

- **`MEDIA_URL = '/media/'`**
  - The URL prefix for user-uploaded files (EOB documents, photos, etc.)
  - Example: An uploaded file will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/media/eob_documents/file.pdf`

- **`MEDIA_ROOT`**
  - Where to actually store uploaded files on your hard drive
  - Creates a `media/` folder in your project root

**The difference between STATIC and MEDIA:**
- **STATIC** = Files you create (your CSS, your JavaScript, your logo)
- **MEDIA** = Files users upload (EOB PDFs, receipt photos)

**Save the file** (`Command + S`)

Your Django settings are now configured! ✅

### Step 10: Create the Database Schema

Now we'll create the database tables Django needs:

```bash
# Create migrations (Django analyzes your models and creates database instructions)
python manage.py makemigrations

# Apply migrations (Actually creates the database tables)
python manage.py migrate
```

**What you'll see:**
```
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  ...
```

This created tables for user authentication, sessions, and admin interface.

### Step 11: Create a Superuser (Admin Account)

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**You'll be prompted for:**
- Username: (enter anything, like `admin`)
- Email: (enter your email or press Enter to skip)
- Password: (enter a password - you won't see it as you type)
- Password (again): (confirm)

**Remember these credentials!** You'll use them to log into the admin interface.

### Step 12: Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

**What you'll see:**
```
Watching for file changes with StatReloader
Performing system checks...

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
January 01, 2025 - 12:00:00
Django version 5.0.1, using settings 'config.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

**Open your browser** and go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

You should see the Django welcome page! 🎉

**Try the admin interface**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

Log in with your superuser credentials.

**To stop the server**: Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## 💳 Building the Insurance Tracker

Now let's build the actual insurance tracking functionality!

### Understanding the Data Model

Before we code, let's think about what data we need to track:

**For the Insurance Policy:**
- Deductible amount (e.g., $2,000)
- Deductible period (annual, per-incident, etc.)
- Current year
- Policy holder name

**For Each EOB Entry:**
- Date of service
- Provider name (doctor, hospital, etc.)
- Service category (office visit, lab work, prescription, etc.)
- Billed amount (what provider charged)
- Insurance paid amount
- You owe amount
- Applied to deductible amount
- Status (pending, paid, etc.)
- Notes
- Uploaded EOB document (PDF or image)

### Step 1: Define the Database Models

**Open** `apps/insurance/models.py` in VSCode.

**Replace the entire file with:**

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.utils import timezone

**What this code does:**

1. **InsurancePolicy model**: Stores policy information and calculates deductible progress
   - `total_spent()` - Adds up all EOB entries
   - `remaining_deductible()` - Shows how much left to pay
   - `deductible_met_percentage()` - For progress bars

2. **ServiceCategory model**: Categories like "Office Visit", "Lab Work", etc.

3. **EOBEntry model**: Each individual EOB with all financial details

**Save the file** (`Command + S`)

### Step 2: Create and Apply Migrations

```bash
# Create migration files based on our new models
python manage.py makemigrations insurance

# Apply the migrations to create database tables
python manage.py migrate insurance
```

**What you'll see:**
```
Migrations for 'insurance':
  apps/insurance/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model InsurancePolicy
    - Create model ServiceCategory
    - Create model EOBEntry
```

### Step 3: Register Models in Admin Interface

**Open** `apps/insurance/admin.py` in VSCode.

**Replace the entire file with:**

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import InsurancePolicy, ServiceCategory, EOBEntry


@admin.register(ServiceCategory)
class ServiceCategoryAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ['name', 'description', 'color']
    search_fields = ['name']


@admin.register(InsurancePolicy)
class InsurancePolicyAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ['policy_name', 'year', 'deductible_amount', 'get_total_spent', 'get_remaining']
    list_filter = ['year']
    search_fields = ['policy_name', 'user__username']

    def get_total_spent(self, obj):
        return f"${obj.total_spent():,.2f}"
    get_total_spent.short_description = 'Total Spent'

    def get_remaining(self, obj):
        return f"${obj.remaining_deductible():,.2f}"
    get_remaining.short_description = 'Remaining'


@admin.register(EOBEntry)
class EOBEntryAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = [
        'date_of_service',
        'provider_name',
        'category',
        'patient_owed',
        'applied_to_deductible',
        'status'
    ]
    list_filter = ['status', 'category', 'date_of_service']
    search_fields = ['provider_name', 'service_description']
    date_hierarchy = 'date_of_service'

    fieldsets = (
        ('Service Information', {
            'fields': ('policy', 'date_of_service', 'provider_name', 'category', 'service_description')
        }),
        ('Financial Details', {
            'fields': ('billed_amount', 'insurance_paid', 'patient_owed', 'applied_to_deductible')
        }),
        ('Status & Payment', {
            'fields': ('status', 'payment_date', 'notes')
        }),
        ('Documents', {
            'fields': ('eob_document',)
        }),
    )
```

**What this does:**
- Registers our models so they appear in the admin interface
- Customizes how data is displayed
- Adds filters and search functionality
- Organizes fields into logical sections

**Save the file** (`Command + S`)

### Step 4: Add Sample Data

Let's add some sample categories and a test policy.

**Start the development server:**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

**Go to the admin interface**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

**Log in** with your superuser credentials.

**Add Service Categories:**
1. Click "Service Categories" → "Add Service Category"
2. Add these categories one by one:
   - Name: "Office Visit", Color: `#3B82F6` (blue)
   - Name: "Lab Work", Color: `#10B981` (green)
   - Name: "Prescription", Color: `#F59E0B` (amber)
   - Name: "Imaging (X-Ray, MRI)", Color: `#8B5CF6` (purple)
   - Name: "Emergency Room", Color: `#EF4444` (red)
   - Name: "Surgery", Color: `#EC4899` (pink)
   - Name: "Physical Therapy", Color: `#06B6D4` (cyan)

**Add an Insurance Policy:**
1. Click "Insurance Policies" → "Add Insurance Policy"
2. Fill in:
   - User: Select your username
   - Policy name: "My Health Insurance 2025"
   - Deductible amount: 2000
   - Deductible period: Annual
   - Year: 2025
3. Click "Save"

**Add Sample EOB Entries:**
1. Click "EOB Entries" → "Add EOB Entry"
2. Example 1:
   - Policy: Select the policy you just created
   - Date of service: Pick a recent date
   - Provider name: "Dr. Smith - Family Practice"
   - Category: Office Visit
   - Service description: "Annual checkup"
   - Billed amount: 250
   - Insurance paid: 200
   - Patient owed: 50
   - Applied to deductible: 50
   - Status: Paid
3. Click "Save and add another"
4. Add a few more entries with different categories and amounts

### Step 5: Create a Simple Dashboard View

Now let's create a web page to view this data (instead of just using the admin).

**Open** `apps/insurance/views.py` in VSCode.

**Replace with:**

```python
from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.db.models import Sum
from .models import InsurancePolicy, EOBEntry, ServiceCategory


@login_required
def dashboard(request):
    """Main dashboard showing all policies"""
    policies = InsurancePolicy.objects.filter(user=request.user)

    context = {
        'policies': policies,
    }
    return render(request, 'insurance/dashboard.html', context)


@login_required
def policy_detail(request, policy_id):
    """Detailed view of a single policy with all EOB entries"""
    policy = get_object_or_404(InsurancePolicy, id=policy_id, user=request.user)

    # Get all EOB entries for this policy
    eob_entries = policy.eob_entries.all()

    # Calculate spending by category
    category_spending = eob_entries.values('category__name', 'category__color').annotate(
        total=Sum('applied_to_deductible')
    ).order_by('-total')

    context = {
        'policy': policy,
        'eob_entries': eob_entries,
        'category_spending': category_spending,
        'total_entries': eob_entries.count(),
    }
    return render(request, 'insurance/policy_detail.html', context)
```

### Step 6: Configure URLs

**Create a new file**: `apps/insurance/urls.py`

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

app_name = 'insurance'

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.dashboard, name='dashboard'),
    path('policy/<int:policy_id>/', views.policy_detail, name='policy_detail'),
]
```

**Open** `config/urls.py` and modify it to include our app's URLs:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('apps.insurance.urls')),  # Add this line
]

# Serve media files in development
if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

### Step 7: Create HTML Templates

**Create the template directories:**
```bash
mkdir -p templates/insurance
```

**Create** `templates/base.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">

### Step 8: Test the Dashboard

**Make sure your server is running:**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

**Visit**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

You should see your insurance policy with a progress bar!

**Click "View Details"** to see the full breakdown with all EOB entries and category spending.

## 🤖 Working with AI Assistants

Now that you have a working foundation, here's how to use AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to build features faster.

### Understanding What AI Assistants Can Do

**AI assistants excel at:**
- Writing boilerplate code
- Explaining existing code
- Debugging errors
- Suggesting implementations
- Creating HTML/CSS layouts
- Writing database queries
- Generating test data

**AI assistants struggle with:**
- Understanding your specific business logic (you need to explain it)
- Knowing your exact file structure (you need to show them)
- Making subjective design decisions (you need to decide)
- Complex debugging across multiple files

### How to Ask Effective Questions

**❌ Bad request:**
"Make my site better"

**✅ Good request:**
"I want to add a feature where users can upload a PDF of their EOB document. The PDF should be stored with the EOBEntry model and displayed as a download link in the policy detail page. Can you help me implement this?"

**Why it's better:**
- Specific feature described
- Clear acceptance criteria (upload PDF, store it, show download link)
- Mentioned relevant model (EOBEntry)

### Example Feature Requests for Your Insurance Tracker

#### Feature 1: PDF Upload and Preview

**Request to AI:**
```
I need to add PDF upload functionality to my EOB entries. Here's what I need:

1. In the admin interface, add a file upload field for EOBEntry
2. Store PDFs in a 'eob_documents/' folder
3. On the policy detail page, show a "View EOB" link for each entry that has a PDF
4. When clicked, open the PDF in a new tab

My EOBEntry model already has an `eob_document` FileField. I just need help with:
- Configuring media file serving in development
- Adding the download link to the template
```

#### Feature 2: Monthly Spending Chart

**Request to AI:**
```
I want to add a simple bar chart showing spending by month for the current year.

Requirements:
- Show on the policy detail page
- Use Chart.js (or suggest a simple alternative)
- X-axis: Months (Jan-Dec)
- Y-axis: Amount applied to deductible
- Use data from EOBEntry.date_of_service and EOBEntry.applied_to_deductible

Can you provide:
1. The Django view code to aggregate monthly spending
2. The template code with Chart.js
3. CDN link for Chart.js
```

#### Feature 3: Email Notifications

**Request to AI:**
```
I want to send an email notification when the user reaches 80% of their deductible.

Requirements:
- Check in the EOBEntry save method
- Only send once per policy per year
- Use Django's built-in email functionality
- Email should include: policy name, total spent, remaining amount

Can you show me:
1. How to override the save() method on EOBEntry
2. How to check if we've already sent the notification (maybe add a field to InsurancePolicy?)
3. Sample email configuration for Gmail SMTP
```

### Working Through Errors with AI

When you get an error, provide:

1. **The full error message** (copy from terminal)
2. **What you were trying to do**
3. **The relevant code** (the file and function where error occurred)

**Example:**

```
I'm getting this error when trying to view the policy detail page:

```
TemplateDoesNotExist at /policy/1/
insurance/policy_detail.html
```

I created the file at templates/insurance/policy_detail.html but Django can't find it.

Here's my settings.py TEMPLATES configuration:
[paste your TEMPLATES setting]

What am I missing?
```

### Iterating on Features

**Start small, then enhance:**

1. **Version 1**: Simple table of EOB entries
2. **Version 2**: Add filtering by category
3. **Version 3**: Add date range filtering
4. **Version 4**: Add export to CSV
5. **Version 5**: Add visual charts

Ask AI to help with one version at a time. Test each version before moving to the next.

### Learning from AI-Generated Code

**Don't just copy-paste. Understand it:**

When AI gives you code, ask follow-up questions:
- "What does this line do?"
- "Why did you use a ForeignKey instead of a CharField here?"
- "What's the difference between `filter()` and `get()`?"
- "Can you explain this list comprehension in simpler terms?"

**Example conversation:**

**You:** [Paste AI-generated code]

**You:** "Can you explain what `aggregate(total=Sum('applied_to_deductible'))` does line by line?"

**AI:** "Sure! This is a Django ORM method that performs a database aggregation:
- `aggregate()` - Tells Django to calculate a summary value across multiple rows
- `total=` - Names the result 'total' so you can access it as `result['total']`
- `Sum('applied_to_deductible')` - Adds up all values in the 'applied_to_deductible' column
- This generates SQL like: SELECT SUM(applied_to_deductible) AS total FROM ..."

### Example AI Conversation for Your Next Feature

Let's say you want to add a "Quick Add EOB" form on the dashboard:

**You:**
"I want to add a simple form on the dashboard page that lets me quickly add an EOB entry without going to the admin. The form should have:
- Date of service (date picker)
- Provider name (text input)
- Category (dropdown)
- Amount applied to deductible (number input)
- Submit button

When submitted, it should create a new EOBEntry and refresh the page. Can you help me implement this with Django forms?"

**AI provides**: Form class, view modification, template HTML

**You test it**

**You:**
"It works! But I want to add client-side validation so the deductible amount can't be negative. How do I add that?"

**AI provides**: HTML5 validation attributes or JavaScript validation

**You:**
"Perfect! One more thing - can the form automatically set the policy to the user's most recent policy instead of showing a dropdown?"

**AI provides**: View modification to auto-set policy

**Keep iterating until perfect!**

## 🗄️ When Should I Upgrade to PostgreSQL?

You might wonder: "When do I switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL?" Here's an honest answer.

### SQLite is Sufficient For

- **Personal projects** (just you using it)
- **Small team apps** (2-5 people, not using it constantly)
- **Development and testing** (always use SQLite locally)
- **Moderate data** (up to 100,000 records is totally fine)
- **Learning** (focus on Django, not database administration)

**Real talk:** Your insurance tracker will likely never outgrow SQLite. Unless you're tracking insurance for an entire company, SQLite is perfect.

### Upgrade to PostgreSQL When

**You have these specific problems:**

1. **Many concurrent users** (20+ people writing to database simultaneously)
   - SQLite locks the entire database during writes
   - PostgreSQL handles concurrent writes gracefully

2. **Large datasets** (millions of records)
   - SQLite slows down on complex queries over huge datasets
   - PostgreSQL is optimized for big data

3. **Advanced features needed**
   - Full-text search across multiple columns
   - Complex JSON queries
   - Stored procedures
   - Row-level locking

4. **Production deployment requirements**
   - Many hosting platforms prefer PostgreSQL
   - Better backup and replication tools
   - Industry standard for production Django apps

### How to Upgrade (When You're Ready)

Switching is actually simple! Here's what changes:

**1. Install PostgreSQL** (one-time setup)
```bash
# Mac
brew install postgresql@16
brew services start postgresql@16

# Or use Docker for easier management
docker run -d \
  --name postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=insurance_tracker \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:16
```

**2. Install the PostgreSQL adapter**
```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

**3. Update settings.py** (just 8 lines)
```python
# Change this:
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}

# To this:
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'insurance_tracker',
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': 'postgres',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

**4. Run migrations again**
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

That's it! Your code doesn't change at all. Django handles the differences.

### My Recommendation

**Start with SQLite. Don't even think about PostgreSQL until:**
- You have a specific problem SQLite can't solve
- You're deploying to production with real users
- You're 6+ months into your project and actually experiencing performance issues

**Why?**
- One less thing to install and manage
- One less thing to break
- More time focusing on building your actual app
- When you do need PostgreSQL, switching takes 10 minutes

Instagram started with SQLite. Stack Overflow started with SQLite. You're in good company.

**Focus on building, not infrastructure.**

## 🤔 "Wait, Should I Use Flask Instead?"

You might hear people say "Flask is simpler for beginners." Let's have an honest conversation about this.

### The "Flask is Simpler" Myth

People say Flask is simpler, and that's... **half true**:

**Flask Hello World:**
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello World"
```

**Django Hello World:**
```python
# Needs settings.py, urls.py, views.py, etc.
# More files, more structure
```

Flask **looks** simpler initially. But once you need:
- Database models → Install SQLAlchemy, configure it
- User login → Install Flask-Login, set up sessions
- Forms → Install Flask-WTF, configure CSRF
- File uploads → Configure upload folders, validation
- Admin panel → Install Flask-Admin, configure every model

Suddenly you're Googling "Flask best practices" and getting 10 different answers.

### Django vs Flask for This Project

**For the insurance EOB tracker specifically:**

| Feature | Django | Flask |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Time to working app** | 30 minutes | 3-4 hours |
| **Lines of code** | ~200 | ~500+ |
| **Admin interface** | Free, automatic | Build it yourself |
| **User authentication** | Built-in | Install + configure extension |
| **Database migrations** | Built-in | Install Alembic, configure |
| **Form validation** | Built-in | Install Flask-WTF |
| **File uploads** | Configured | Configure manually |
| **Security (CSRF, XSS)** | Enabled by default | Configure yourself |

### Django Advantages for This Project

**1. Admin Interface (Huge Time Saver)**
- Django: Free, automatic admin panel to manage data
- Flask: You'd need to build every form, table, and CRUD interface manually

**2. Less Code to Write**
- Django EOB tracker: ~200 lines of Python
- Flask equivalent: ~500+ lines (need to add Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, Flask-WTF, etc.)

**3. Fewer Decisions**
- Django: "There's one obvious way" - just follow the structure
- Flask: "Should I use SQLAlchemy or Peewee? WTForms or Flask-WTF? Jinja templates where?" = decision fatigue

**4. Better for Learning Full-Stack Concepts**
- Django teaches you how complete web apps work as a system
- Flask teaches you Python fundamentals, but you'll need to learn how to connect the pieces

### When Flask Is Actually Better

**Flask shines for:**
- Simple APIs (just a few endpoints)
- Learning Python basics first (less "magic")
- Microservices
- When you want maximum control
- Very simple single-page apps
- When you already know web development and want lightweight

### Where Beginners Get Stuck

**Django beginners struggle with:**
- "What's a migration?" (but you'll learn this quickly)
- "Where does this file go?" (but the structure prevents chaos later)
- "Why so much boilerplate?" (but it's solving problems you don't know you have yet)

**Flask beginners struggle with:**
- "Which packages should I use?" (analysis paralysis)
- "How do I structure this?" (everyone's app looks different)
- "Why isn't this working?" (misconfigured extensions)
- "How do I add user accounts?" (watch a 2-hour tutorial)
- "Did I configure security correctly?" (easy to make mistakes)

### The Uncomfortable Truth

For your insurance tracker, Flask would mean:
- ✅ More control over every detail
- ✅ Less "magic" happening behind the scenes
- ✅ Lighter weight (fewer dependencies)
- ❌ 3-4x more code to write
- ❌ More security mistakes possible
- ❌ No admin interface (you'd build forms for everything)
- ❌ Longer time to working product

**Is that worth it?** Or do you want to track your medical expenses sometime this month?

### The Real Question

**What's your actual goal?**

**1. "I want to understand how web apps work from scratch"**
→ Flask is better. You'll wire everything up manually and understand each piece.

**2. "I want to build this insurance tracker and actually use it"**
→ Django is better. Focus on your domain logic, not plumbing.

**3. "I want to become a professional developer"**
→ Learn both eventually. Start with Django for structure, then Flask shows you what Django does behind the scenes.

### My Recommendation

**Stick with Django for this project because:**

1. You want to build something **useful quickly** (track real insurance data)
2. The admin interface lets you focus on logic, not building forms
3. You have a template already set up
4. Django's structure prevents beginner mistakes
5. When you understand Django, Flask will be trivial to learn later

**Consider Flask later when:**
- You understand databases, routing, templates, authentication
- You want to build a simple API
- You want to learn "how it works under the hood"
- You're building a microservice that does one thing

### The Analogy

- **Django** = Learning to drive with an automatic transmission car that has GPS, parking assist, and lane-keeping
- **Flask** = Learning to drive with a manual transmission and a paper map

Both get you there, but for a total beginner trying to accomplish a real goal (not just learn), the automatic car gets you driving safely much faster.

### The Bottom Line

**The best framework is the one that gets you building.**

Paralysis by analysis kills more beginner projects than choosing the "wrong" framework. Pick one, build something, ship it. You can always rebuild in Flask later if you want - but you'll have a working product in the meantime.

Django isn't "training wheels" - it's the framework that Instagram, Pinterest, and The Washington Post use in production. It scales from beginner projects to billion-user platforms.

Start with Django. Build your insurance tracker. Learn the concepts. Then evaluate if Flask makes sense for your next project.
